# Programmer Browser


A fast-searching and space-saving browser specially designed for programmers.



#### :star: Support Us

If you like our project, do not forget to give stars. So we can get more attention and get more support from the community. Don't underestimate one star, one star you give will convince others to give the project another star.



#### :angel: Developer Advice

For a more comfortable use, I recommend that you take advantage of your operating system's ability to add shortcuts to the keyboard. With this feature, you can open and close the browser more easily.



## :muscle: Motivation

Hello, I am a programmer. And I need to speed dial while writing code. That's why standard browsers don't do much for me. My goal in this project is to create a useful browser that allows quick searches for programmers like me.
